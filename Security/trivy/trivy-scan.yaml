# /Security/trivy/trivy-scan.yaml
# ArgoCD-compatible: all ${VAR} placeholders replaced with hardcoded values.
# Default values match security.sh defaults.
#
# FIXES:
#   Bug 2 — PVC accessModes changed from ReadWriteMany → ReadWriteOnce.
#            ReadWriteMany requires a storage class that supports multi-node
#            concurrent access (NFS, AWS EFS, GCP Filestore, Azure Files, etc.).
#            Minikube, Kind, K3s, and standard K8s all default to the hostPath /
#            local provisioner which only supports ReadWriteOnce. Using RWX on
#            these clusters causes PVCs to stay Pending indefinitely.
#            Both PVCs (cache + reports) are only ever mounted by one pod at a
#            time (CronJob is Forbid, exporter is a single replica), so RWO is
#            correct and sufficient.
#
#   Bug 3 — Image references changed from hardcoded "hiteshmondaldocker/..."
#            to environment variable substitution via ${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME} and
#            ${TRIVY_IMAGE_TAG}. The whole project builds images with the
#            operator's DockerHub username from .env — hardcoding a specific
#            username means the CronJob and initial Job always pull the original
#            author's images regardless of what was built and pushed by security.sh.
#
#   Bug 4 — Added activeDeadlineSeconds to both the CronJob jobTemplate and the
#            initial Job. Without a deadline, a hung scan (network timeout, DB
#            download failure, unresponsive registry) blocks indefinitely.
#            With concurrencyPolicy: Forbid on the CronJob, one stuck job prevents
#            ALL subsequent scheduled runs permanently until manually deleted.
